# Pegasus for Dialogue Summarization

## Overview
This project aims to leverage the Pegasus model for summarizing dialogues. The Pegasus model is a transformer-based model specifically designed for text summarization tasks. In this project, we focus on using Pegasus for summarizing dialogues, which can be useful in various applications such as chatbots, customer support systems, and conversational agents.

## Key Features
- Train a Pegasus model for dialogue summarization using provided datasets.
- Evaluate the trained model using evaluation metrics like ROUGE scores.
- Make predictions on new dialogue samples using the trained model.
- Save and load trained models for future use.

## Installation Instructions
1. Install the required Python packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers[sentencepiece] datasets sacrebleu rouge_score py7zr -q
   pip install --upgrade accelerate
   pip uninstall -y transformers accelerate
   pip install transformers accelerate
